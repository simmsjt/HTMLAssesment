    <p>With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Get tough with it, get strong. Trees grow however makes them happy.

You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Just use the old one inch brush.

That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Use your imagination, let it go. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.
